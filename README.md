This depot is simply put a way for people to have a base for making Quake 2 content. Code is untouched from the original GPL release(except gamex86.dll is now just game.dll) but having everyone in one spot in a good starting point for people to make stuff.
     * Cmake files openable directly from Visual Studio 2022 for compiling the game, engine, editor(qe4 the original editor), bsp, rad, and vis. Build all builds everything.
     * Quake 2 Demo all files in there are property of id software and are only there to get the game up and running. All content will have to be created by you.
